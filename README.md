# EV-AFV-Insights
In this project, I dive into the analysis of Electric and Alternative Fuel Vehicles using SQL queries and dynamic Tableau visualizations to uncover specifications, performance, and trends.

<h3>Background</h3>
The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation with an increasing focus on sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) have gained significant attention as potential solutions to address these challenges. This project aims to analyze and visualize data on EVs and AFVs available in the market to gain insights into their specifications, performance, and trends. By leveraging SQL queries and Tableau visualizations, we will explore various aspects of these vehicles to uncover patterns and answer key business questions.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
The shift towards electric and alternative fuel vehicles has the potential to revolutionize the transportation sector, impacting manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers alike. This project is motivated by the need to understand the current landscape of EVs and AFVs in the market, identify factors influencing their adoption, and provide valuable insights for consumers, manufacturers, and policymakers. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to contribute to informed decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of the sustainable transportation options available.

<h3>Dataset</h3>

The dataset I have chosen for this project presents a comprehensive collection of data pertaining to Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) available in the United States. It encompasses vehicles from various manufacturers, model years, and categories. Each entry in the dataset offers insights into the specifications, performance metrics, and environmental impact of these vehicles. With a total of 18 columns, including a class column, this dataset equips us to explore and analyze the landscape of eco-friendly transportation in the US.

These features, described in detail below, play a pivotal role in unraveling valuable information about the state of Electric and Alternative Fuel Vehicles in the US market:

<b>Category</b>: The classification of vehicles into groups such as sedans, SUVs, trucks, etc., based on their body style and usage.

<b>Model</b>: The specific name or identifier of the vehicle model, distinguishing it from others.

<b>Model Year</b>: The year in which the vehicle model was manufactured and introduced to the market.

<b>Manufacturer</b>: The company responsible for producing the vehicle.

<b>Fuel</b>: Indicates the type of fuel used by the vehicle, such as electricity, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or other alternative fuels.

<b>All-Electric Range</b>: The distance a fully charged electric vehicle can travel solely on electric power before requiring recharging.

<b>PHEV Total Range</b>: For Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), this is the combined range when utilizing both electric power and conventional fuel.

<b>Alternative Fuel Economy City, Highway, Combined</b>: The estimated fuel efficiency of the vehicle when using alternative fuels (excluding gasoline/diesel) in city, highway, and combined driving conditions.

<b>Conventional Fuel Economy City, Highway, Combined</b>: Similar to alternative fuel economy, but for vehicles using conventional gasoline or diesel.

<b>Transmission Type</b>: The mechanism that transfers power from the engine to the wheels, categorized by automatic, manual, CVT (continuously variable transmission), etc.

<b>Transmission Make</b>: The manufacturer or brand of the transmission used in the vehicle.

<b>Engine Type</b>: The kind of engine the vehicle uses, such as internal combustion, electric motor, or hybrid system.

<b>Engine Size</b>: The volume of the engine's cylinders, often measured in liters or cubic inches, indicating its capacity.

<b>Engine Cylinder Count</b>: The total number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.

<b>Max. Number of Passengers</b>: The maximum seating capacity of the vehicle, specifying the number of passengers it can accommodate.

<b>Heavy-Duty Power System</b>: Denotes whether the vehicle is equipped with a heavy-duty power system, which is important for larger vehicles like trucks or buses.

<b>Notes</b>: Additional comments or details about the vehicle that might not fit into the other categories.

<b>Drivetrain</b>: The system responsible for transmitting power to the wheels, specifying if the vehicle is front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, etc.
